Topics such as violent games and aggression, playtime and wellbeing, and more are characterized by deeply divided opinions and conflicting results even at the meta-analytic level. I argue that much of this disagreement stems from limitations of common methods, including use of problematic self-report measures, overreliance on cross-sectional research, and superficial use of theory, among others. To resolve debates more effectively, I describe six practices games research should adopt more widely: 1) strengthening the theoretical derivation chain, 2) attending to inter-individual effect size variation, 3) prioritizing longitudinal, within-person studies, 4) harnessing digital trace data, 5) controlling individual game features, and 6) adopting open research principles. For each practice, I include practical steps and resources for implementing them in one’s own work. While critical of the current state of knowledge, the paper is hopeful: with the help of these practices, the next generation of video games research can be the most informative yet.","tags":null,"title":"A Manifesto for More Productive Psychological Games Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" It’s undeniably great that blogdown/Hugo Academic (now Wowchemy) made creating a professional website so accessible, but there is a notable downside: it became really hard to make your site stand out.\nTo try and leave a slightly more lasting mark, I spent more hours than I’d like to admit googling around, finding little tweaks that would differentiate my website from the standard template. I’m generally happy with the result, and I figured if I could cut down on others’ frustration by sharing what I did, that’s the least I could do. I have no web design experience and struggled throughout with HTML/CSS/Go, as well as with the general structure of the website. In other words, if I can do it, so can you!\nThe full codebase for my website is available on Github.\nThese alterations often failed to work out of the box for me when borrowing others’ code, and they similarly may not work for you. Due to differences in1) Wowchemy versions and idiosyncratic parts of your setup, and 2) poor documentation on my part after too many hours of trial and error, these tips are more about pointing you in the right direction with sources rather than directly solving your problems. Setting up your site These tips assume that you already have a working, deployed version of a Wowchemy site. This is too large a topic to dive into here, but some of the resources I found helpful when first doing this include:\nDan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Andreas Handel’s post on creating a website in under an hour Wowchemy’s own tutorial/guide (duh) Basics of Wowchemy/Hugo Customization Customizations to your Wowchemy site typically take one of 4 forms:\nChanging a predefined parameter in the config/_default files (mainly params.yaml and config.yaml) Altering a theme in data/themes - for exmaple, I created a file data/themes/my_theme.toml where I set all of the colors for both light and dark mode across the website. I can highly recommend Coolers for trying out different color palettes until you find one you’re happy with. Adding/changing a partial—essentially a bit of code that defines a certain design feature on your website. For example, partials might define where your profile picture appears, the number of columns used to display the content of a given page, the presence of a background image, and much more. Using partials was by far the hardest part of Wowchemy for me to wrap my head around. By default, partials are defined in your theme, and can be found under themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/modules/wowchemy/v5/layouts/partials (I know, it really feels like they could’ve simplified that folder structure a bit). You should never alter these files in the theme itself. Instead, you should make a copy of partials, and put them in a new folder at the root of your directory: layouts/partials. The partials in your root directory will override the “default” ones in the theme, allowing you to change the design without risking breaking anything—you can always just delete the custom partial. Changing the styling with custom SCSS code (which is just CSS code, but fancier). You can add a file called custom.scss inside assets/scss folder (again, you may need to create this folder first). Within this file, you use CSS code to specify certain elements/classes of elements, and can change their visual properties. This might include the formatting of your headings, various colors or padding, animations (see below), and much more. If you master these four strategies for customizing your website, you’ll have the main tools in your toolkit for making your website stand out from the crowd. As above, it’s beyond the scope of this post to teach you how to do each of these things thoroughly, but here are some resources that helped me:\nThe basics of predefined parameters: Dan Quintana’s blog post on creating your website Getting to grips with custom.scss: Connor Rothschild’s blog post Understanding how partials work: noisyoscillator’s post on customizing Hugo websites; Yorkyard’s getting started with Hugo partials Setting up a Blogdown site from scratch, with lots of custom tweaks, by Mark Druffel Changes on my site About widget The about widget is the first thing your visitors are going to see, and therefore was the aspect I spent the most time customizing.

Once I published my first paper and realized “oh, I can do this”, suddenly everything that wasn’t in service of an upcoming publication or similar output started to feel like at best a distraction, and at worst a waste of time. In fact, my outlooks has deteriorated to the extent that learning new research-related things sometimes feels like a hobby rather than an integral part of my work. (You’ll catch me on weekends listening to Quantitude, a highly pedagogical podcast about quantitative methods—to be fair, they do spend half of each episode making dad jokes, but I can safely say I’ve learned as much from them as I have from any stats textbook).\nTwo crucial caveats here: 1) I fully recognize how problematic this mindset is, and that researchers should be evaluated on much more than the sum quantity of their outputs, and 2) I’m exaggerating a bit for dramatic effect—I do certainly learn a lot during my actual work time. But the reality is, in a environment where every career move feels precarious, and the currency of your advancement is publications, there are legitimate reasons to be laser focused on those outputs and put learning on the back burner, and that’s something I regularly find myself falling victim to.\nIt sounds like I’m not alone, either. A while back, Daniel Lakens asked researchers how much time they’d like to have for learning new skills. The model response seemed to be approximately 1 day a week, but few people found that they were able to achieve this. My supervisor, Sebastian Deterding, described an even more grim reality in the replies (see image). How depressing is that, that our profession leaves hardly any time for even applying hard-(l)earned skills, much less learning for learning’s sake?\nA depressing description of life as a senior academic. Let me illustrate with an example from my own experience. My math background is quite poor; after finishing calculus in high school, I pivoted towards non-quantitative social science topics for my bachelor, and therefore have had hardly any formal math training since. I have more or less learned to mimic what good statisticians in my field do in a given situation, and can usually understand the general insight behind what a statistical model is trying to do and where it can go wrong, but my understanding of what’s happening under the hood can be really quite poor.\nSo, I tell myself “I’m going to go learn some linear algebra”. At the moment, I have minimal responsibilities aside from my thesis and the luxury of being able—at least on paper—to go do exactly that. But psychologically, I find it very difficult. Pragmatically, only after every other “to-do” on my list is completed do I feel like I can justify some dedicated learning time. But inevitably, this time will become fragmented by incoming emails, tasks, or simply ideas for work that might contribute more directly to my career progression. This feeling, that learning ends up being the lowest of my priorities, is exacerbated by the perception that the thing I’d like to learn about is particularly new or difficult. When I have finally cleared the to-do list enough to sit down and study some linear algebra, I find myself discouraged at my rate of progress—compared to the 8+ hours per week I dedicated to learning new things during my bachelor (combined with some rapidly decaying neural plasticity), learning enough to fully grasp the applications of the math I’m interested in (quantitative methods papers, codebases, etc) feels insurmountable.1\nSimilar patterns play out with other things I’d like to learn, not just in my work but in my daily life (looking at you, oft-neglected keyboard in the living room corner). At the ripe age of 28, I worry that the period of my life in which I could devote substantial time to learning for learning’s sake was all too short. And frankly, if I’d known what I know now, I’d probably have spent it differently.2\nI doubt I need to convince you of the long-term benefit of learning for learning’s sake, both for one’s general well-being and for one’s professional development. But even as someone who consciously tries to place value on intellectual and personal growth, I find my tangible short-term interests more compelling than my ethereal long-term ones.\nWhat to do? You’ll be disappointed (if unsurprised) to learn that I do not have any silver bullet solutions to this problem, neither for myself nor for others. However, describing my problems in a dark monospace RStudio window always seems to help me work through some potential ideas. Let’s discuss a few.\n1.

When I think about this in the context of my own life, the situation is clear: by a wide margin, I experience relatedness frustration most on Twitter. I often have trouble distilling my thoughts until I try to write them down, so in case it’d be useful to anyone else, I thought I’d try to unpack why Twitter has this negative effect on me.\nHere’s the situation. My Screen Time data show that I spent 30–45 minutes per day on Twitter most weeks. Most of this will come in the form of 3–5 minute scrolls, many times a day—when I’m making coffee, when I need a pomodoro-like break from other tasks, etc. Very often, I’ll find something useful during that brief scroll, be it a paper, news update, or simply a meme/video able to make me laugh. I may like a few tweets along the way, but I’ll almost never post anything or reply to anyone myself, for reasons I’ll discuss shortly. Later—sometimes as soon as I put the phone down, but certainly the next time I reflect upon my media behavior—I’m left with a sense of being disconnected or alienated, with a corresponding uptick in anxiety and dissatisfaction. And yet, the next day, I find myself going back and repeating the whole loop all over again.\nThis situation actually describes a form of mild dysregulation—difficulty managing one’s behavior such that it leads to impairment or distress. I’d probably endorse, at least to some degree, the criteria for loss of control and escapism (i.e., I have difficulty reducing my Twitter use even though I consciously want to, and I use it to escape or relieve bad moods). It’s worth noting that the validity of these criteria are disputed, including by me. But the point here is that I’m someone who researches dysregulated use of technology, and I have trouble regulating my use of technology. Maybe I should be putting this in my conflict of interest statements.\nSo, this begs the question, why do I keep using the site? It’s clear that there are conflicting motivations, so let’s break those down in a list of pros and cons. Some of these are less directly related to feelings of social (dis)connection, but they’re all factors in my continued use of a platform where I feel a sense of exclusion.\nThe benefits of using Twitter (for me) Finding useful papers and resources - It’s clear to me that I’d be several months behind the “leading edge” of research in my field if I weren’t on Twitter. As much as half the new papers I find are because a researcher I follow has tweeted about them. I use Stork for notifications of recently published work, have considered messing around with RSS feeds, might be able to scan PsyArXiv from time to time to find new work, but all of this pales in comparison to having a direct line of communication with others working in my area, and them sharing their work as soon as its available. The same is true for other learning resources; I’ve just started Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking lecture series, which has been enormously valuable and something I doubt I’d have found without Twitter.\nEvesdropping on useful discussions - Twitter is abound with useful conversations between people trying to solve a problem. I tend to see this among the statistics community on there; just today I stumbled upon an excellent discussion of when and why singular fit warnings might occur even if the estimated variance isn’t exactly 0. At the risk of outing myself as an lurker given that I’ve never interacted with these people, I have learned loads from “listening in” on conversations with people like Brenton Wiernik, Isabella Ghement, Solomon Kurz, and others. (Not only do they have insightful solutions to complicated stats problems, they also manage to distill them into 280 characters! A degree of concision I strive for.)\nFilling my empty moments with stimulation because I, alongside many others from younger generations, are incapable of being alone with our thoughts for too long - Maybe we’d better not open this can of worms right now.\nThe cons of using Twitter (for me) Shame caused by constant confrontation with others’ announcements, celebrations, achievements, etc. As many others have described before, the constant bombardment by others’ successes on social media can be psychologically challenging. This, unfortunately, is already one of my biggest vices; I really struggle not to automatically engage in social comparison. It’s not that I have imposter syndrome in the sense of “I don’t belong in this career”—I think I do good work at a reasonable pace and have at least as much potential to succeed in academia as many of my peers—but I do absolutely have imposter syndrome in the sense of “why are you not as good as these other people”.

We also do not know how need frustration arises in video games, nor how it leads to disengagement. We therefore conducted a semi-structured interview study with 12 video game players, following grounded theory methods to develop a model of need-frustrating play. We find that need frustration is a common and impactful experience in games, with distinct antecedents not fully captured in existing measures.

Significant attention has been directed towards the idea that these public health measures may have unanticipated negative side-effects. A nascent evidence base suggests that individuals played video games for longer during lockdowns and school closures in specific. This increase in playtime per gamer is linked to the potential for lockdowns to induce gaming disorder. However, the evidence base regarding lockdowns and disordered gaming is based on self-report and is susceptible to bias. It is therefore unclear what the true consequences of lockdowns were for gaming behaviour across the world – disordered or otherwise. **Design**: This is a longitudinal study, utilising 2 years worth of data. Rather than rely on self-report, we analyse approximately 251 billion hours of raw gameplay telemetry data from 184 separate countries to assess the behavioural correlates of COVID-related policy decisions. A multilevel model estimated the impact of eight containment and closure policies on the amount of time that individual users spend in-game. Similar models estimate the impact of policy on overall playtime and number of users within a country. **Results**: Whilst school closures are associated with increases in both playtime (r2=0.048, 95%CI: 0.042 – 0.056, p\u003c0.001) and the number of unique individuals playing games (r2=0.057, 95%CI: 0.050 – 0.065, p\u003c0.001), no lockdown policy can explain substantial variance in playtime per gamer. **Conclusions**: Lockdown policies were not associated with important increases in playtime per user. While there were significant concerns about the public health implications of increased video game playtime during lockdowns, unbiased telemetry data fails to corroborate these concerns.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding whether lockdowns lead to increases in the heaviness of gaming using massive-scale data telemetry: An analysis of 251 billion hours of playtime","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Introduction [Note: The contents of this blog post are available in even further abbreviated form by checking out the slides I used to present this paper at the 2022 IGGI Conference.]\nAfter over a year of painstaking progress, I’ve finally completed a study about certain types of frustrating experiences in games, and how they affect players’ experience and behavior. The full paper is available on PsyArXiv as a preprint while it undergoes peer review, but in the meantime I wanted to make a shorter summary available as a blog post.\nThe study’s goal was to understand when and why need frustration—experiences such as failure, loneliness, or coercion—arises in video games, and what it has on players’ behavior.\nWe found some really interesting things—need frustration is common in games, and it has important impacts on players’ decisions to continue playing a game or not, as well as the emotional experiences they have when they play. We show that this happens through the violation of expectations about a game, an idea that hasn’t appeared very much in the research literature on games yet. Perhaps most interestingly, our results hint that need frustration may be a useful way to differentiate “positive”, motivating frustration from “negative”, demotivating frustration—a distinction most players and designers are familiar with.\nWhat is need frustration in games? Need frustration is an idea built upon a well-known and well-evidenced psychological theory known as self-determination theory. One claim this theory makes is that humans have innate and universal basic needs for1:\nAutonomy: the need to feel that one is in control over their own life and that one’s actions are self-endorsed Competence: the need to act effectively and feel capable in one’s activities Relatedness: the need to love and care, to be loved and cared for; to have one’s “true self” accepted by others and feel part of groups When these needs are satisfied by an activity, people tend to enjoy the things they do, do them more, and feel better after doing them. On the other hand, when they are actively frustrated, people tend to enjoy them less, do them less, and feel worse after doing them.\nIn the table below, I’ve given some examples of need-satisfying and need-frustrating experiences in games. We know that games are really good at satisfying needs, generally; this is precisely why they’re so intrinsically motivating. But this is not universal: at other times, games can be very frustrating and demotivating. While we know that need-frustrating experiences are part of gaming too, we don’t know what they look like—when they occur, how people feel when they happen, and how they affect motivation. (Spoiler: I’m only able to give these examples because we’ve now done the study!)\nNeed Example of satisfying experience Example of frustrating experience autonomy selecting an avatar that closely matches your desired in-game representation feeling forced to log in daily to receive a reward that may expire competence overcoming a difficult boss after learning its attack patterns playing against opponents so good, you feel it doesn’t matter what you do relatedness connecting deeply with a particular character’s story being harassed by other players for low performance What we did We decided to address this by interviewing players about their experiences. We conducted and transcribed a total of 12 interviews, and used a method called grounded theory to develop a working model of how need frustration occurred and what consequences it had for players. The goal, and indeed hardest part about using grounded theory, is to constant challenge the model and try to “break” it—in this method, you choose whom to interview one person at a time and keep updating your list of questions, so that you can generate the data that would be most likely to either enrich or contradict your ideas.\nWe interviewed a total of 12 players from 8 different countries who each played a variety of different games, and who included a variety of ages, genders, and relationships to gaming. Each interview lasted about an hour.\nWhat we found Below is the visual summary of the model we came up with.\nNeed frustration occurs when players’ experience a need-frustrating situation that is more intense than they expected. Over time, need frustration experiences cause players’ to alter their expectations for future experiences. These expectations in turn lead them to change their behavior: they might alterations to play behavior aimed at reducing future need frustration. Sometimes, if there are other motivating factors, or \u0026#34;extrinsic motivations\u0026#34;, players might choose to continue playing despite expecting it to be need-frustrating. need-frustrating.

At the end, I include 6 ideas for strengthening these relationships I’d like to implement in my own group someday (if I stay in academia—a big if!)\nDorothy excelled in many areas—she was prolific in her research, creative pursuits, science communication, and disruption of the status quo—but the most striking testament to her legacy was the sheer number of people that came up to talk about the impact she’d had on them. The ripples of her commitment to supporting early career researchers will propagate long after her retirement.\nI was particularly impressed by Dorothy’s academic genealogical tree, something several speakers highlighted. Dorothy’s PhD students or postdocs had gone on to supervise other PhD students, and they to supervise yet more—and many of these connections were maintained throughout the years. Their academic genealogical tree was rich, and its foliage no doubt played an important role in the success of successive generations (no pun intended).\nLet’s take this metaphor a little further. I’ll refer to a supervisor and their core PhD students, postdocs, or other mentees as one’s academic nuclear family. The previous and successive generations of these are an academic extended family. Finally, other groups around the department are one’s academic neighborhood. Strong academic nuclear families, extended families, and neighborhoods both support satisfaction at work, as well as provide tangible career benefits:\nStrong nuclear families can make a new mentee feel immediately at home, integrating into their new environment as soon as they arrive. Nuclear family members are the most likely to be deeply invested in others’ success, and may be more likely to do things like nominate their ‘siblings’ for awards, and include them on publications—if publications are the currency of academic advancement, carefully circumscribed contributions to others’ papers offer some of the best investments around. Strong extended families expose a new mentee to longer-term career trajectories. They foster connections at institutions beyond one’s home, and embed mentees more deeply into the history of their field of study (an especially valuable point for someone like me who finds themselves rarely reading work older than 10 years). Strong neighborhoods ensure that people are exposed to a breadth of interests and backgrounds. They provide for small favors, whether that be help with study recruitment, finding someone with experience in that niche statistical model you’re using, or sharing resources like hardware. They also impress upon everyone the sense of working together—the fireperson and the librarian may not have so much in common, but they’re both working to improve the livelihoods of the townspeople around them. The importance of these networks, by no means exhaustively detailed above, stood out to me at #DBfest in large part because they highlighted some of the deficits in my own.\nTo unpack this, I need to extend the metaphor one more time. Let’s think of one’s core academic field as where they’re from: their country or cultural background. It was powerful to see the shared culture in Dorothy Bishop’s extended family—many of her mentees remained closely connected to her work in developmental neuropsychology, using similar methods to study similar questions. This was no doubt helped by Dorothy’s clear “cultural identity”, fitting relatively comfortably into established disciplinary boundaries. To be clear, I don’t at all mean to gloss over an expansive amount of diversity in these groups; I simply want to highlight what came across to me as a strong overall coherence.\nBy contrast, my academic families are somewhat more eclectic, with many (literal and figurative) immigrants. Games research is inherently very interdiscplinary, with researchers pulling from fields like psychology, computer science, sociology, philosophy, and more—my academic nuclear family has included people whose work involved linguistics, computational creativity, and environmental science, among other areas that are all equally fascinating but culturally distant from my own.\nHaving such multiculturalism in one’s academic family is wonderful, exposing each member to ideas and ways of thinking that they’d otherwise never be exposed to—but it’s not without trade-offs. People may speak (literal and figurative) different languages, and have more difficulty connecting deeply with each other. And while we all share an identity as researchers, there may not be sufficient common ground for the more practical day-to-day familial benefits, …","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"1c8e8805d37b65eaf86dd71edc74f993","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/fostering-academic-family-tree/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/fostering-academic-family-tree/","section":"blog","summary":"Some observations about the familial social circles academics form, inspired by the wonderful Dorothy Bishop Festschrift.","tags":[],"title":"How to Foster Strong Academic Families","type":"blog"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Paul Cairns","Rachel Meyer","Stuart Waters","Nick Ballou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655683200,"objectID":"24aee59c40635975b7d101f3f9a08c18","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2022-zendle-et-al-ifeverything/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-zendle-et-al-ifeverything/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background and Aims** Loot boxes are items in video games that may be bought for real-world money but provide ran- domized rewards. Formal similarities between loot boxes and gambling have led to concerns that they may provide a ‘gateway’ to gambling amongst children. However, the availability of loot boxes is unclear. This study aimed to determine what proportion of top-grossing video games contained loot boxes, and how many of those games were available to children. **Design, setting and cases** Survey of the 100 top-grossing games on both the Google Play store and the Apple App store, and the top 50 most-played games on Steam according to the data aggregator SteamSpy. Measurements The prevalence of loot boxes was measured for each platform outlined above, split by age rating. **Findings** A total of 58.0% of the top games on the Google Play store contained loot boxes, 59.0% of the top iPhone games contained loot boxes and 36.0% of the top games on the Steam store contained loot boxes; 93.1% of the Android games that featured loot boxes and 94.9% of the iPhone games that featured loot boxes were deemed suitable for children aged 12+.

I wanted to be a somewhat-better-than-average researcher offering some insights into video game engagement and well-being. Our doctoral training center is relatively industry-facing, and talks a lot about “impact”—in my case, I thought my work might help designers and developers make better and more well-being supportive games, in some vague sense. As with many PhD students, I’d been academically successful in high school and university, but was wary of being surrounded by people who gotten past yet another series of selection effects. I’d heard the countless warnings about impostor syndrome, and knew to temper my expectations of myself in light of that.\nIn my first year, however, I discovered that I was pretty good at this whole research thing—even relative to the other extremely smart people around me who had chosen to pursue a PhD. I attribute this largely to having stumbled upon the open science movement early, essentially through a chance series of encounters and a single off-hand remark made while I was still applying for positions. I took Daniël Lakens’ now-famous Improving your Statistical Inferences course, and I found myself asking questions about how we generate knowledge in a way that was extremely helpful in planning my early work and navigating academic structures. That I had highly invested supervisors, stable funding, and am a cishet white guy from an upper middle class background with no care responsibilities no doubt helped tremendously as well.\nSo over time, my goals became more ambitious. Looking back, I might even describe these as bordering on delusions of grandeur: I wanted to be publishing cutting-edge work in the biggest venues, and I wanted to be known as a leader in the field. I hoped my work would inform policymakers, clinicians, parents and players, but above all else, I started to think about how the meta-scientific and methodological aspects of my work might influence other researchers, contributing to a change in how an entire problem is understood and studied (see the work of one of my biggest sources of both inspiration and envy, Amy Orben, for a perfect example of this). For a good chunk of my second year, I felt like I was making good progress towards these goals, and having that corroborated by others like my supervisors, was deeply validating. My self-confidence, both in and outside of work, was probably as secure as it has ever been.\nFast forward to now (halfway through year 3), however, and things have changed rather radically. While some of those ambitions still seem within reach, others do not, and I’m not sure if I value them in the first place. I’m proud of (most of) my work, both in terms of published outputs and non-research activities, but no longer particularly believe in its impact—even within the academy, much less outside of it. I see a generation of researchers born and bred in the open science movement, leaving me with no doubt that in 5 or 10 or 20 years the social sciences will be in a much, much healthier place, and I’m glad to participate in it. But I no longer believe that my contribution is of note.\nThis newfound dispiritedness is closely tied with my changing thoughts about academia itself. After a few years of being convinced I’d apply for academic jobs, that path now seems increasingly untenable. Research is still, for the time being, often low quality and unverifiable. And even the highest quality work in my field struggles to demonstrate its value outside of the ivory tower. Salaries are not just stagnating but decreasing in real terms, pensions are being threatened, and the competition for places is growing ever more fervent. I’ve tried my hand at teaching (albeit online) and grant-writing and have found neither very enjoyable. Put all those things together, and is the trade-off justified? For me, at the moment, no.\nThe problem is, academic research was the first activity where I thought I could be better than “pretty good”. It has felt like my first opportunity to maybe be great at something. The activity that, for a while, was more intrinsically motivating than any other such endeavor I’d undertaken, where I could actually envision doing the work necessary to truly stand out. And as someone who is naturally competitive, placed into an often viciously competitive ecosystem, I’m not ashamed to admit that I wanted that greatness. (Note: I’m not talking about competitiveness at Queen Mary or with my cohort—everyone there has been nothing but supportive and mutually uplifting—but rather in the atmosphere of academia more broadly). If I leave this path, what other opportunities to be great do I have left? What if that answer is none—is that okay?\nWhen I look at the people I most admire, I see greatness in all of them. I see people getting recognition at the highest levels of scientific achievement. I see prolific open source contributors, and community organizers who at the drop of the hat are ready …","date":1649072884,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649072884,"objectID":"b34a97529aa2bbee4b48347b8fa03ee4","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/ambition-and-contentment/","publishdate":"2022-04-04T12:48:04+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog/ambition-and-contentment/","section":"blog","summary":"Ramblings on a mental battle occasioned by ambition in academia.","tags":[],"title":"Ambition and Contentment","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Nick Ballou","Sebastian Deterding","Ioanna Iacovides","Laura Helsby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"7ecf10aa2ba875e7dd9df82ebd7d9c4d","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2022-ballou-et-al-do-people/","publishdate":"2022-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-ballou-et-al-do-people/","section":"publication","summary":"Do people use games to cope with adverse life events and crises?

To address this, we conduct an individual participant meta-analysis comprised of primary data from 15 studies (n = 38,851). Study 1 finds that meeting the DSM-5's proposed 5/9 diagnostic threshold is associated with d = .65 greater distress across 21 well-being constructs, which exceeds a conservative anchor for clinical significance. However, we also find that classifying participants above and below the 5/9 threshold has little power to reject that threshold: a 2/9 cut-off predicts similarly large differences. Study 2 shows that dimensional (continuous) modelling of IGD scores offers a more severe test of the proposed threshold. Finally, study 3 reveals that three criteria—preoccupation, tolerance, and loss of control—are roughly half as predictive of distress as withdrawal and escapism, highlighting limitations also present in dimensional modelling and suggesting the need to modify or remove these. In sum, we do not find evidence for invalidating IGD as proposed, but do identify issues with threshold-based categorization, inadequate differentiation between statistical and clinical significance, and the inclusion of potentially flawed criteria. We argue that these are possible negative consequences of a premature switch to confirmatory research on IGD.","tags":null,"title":"“Clinically significant distress” in internet gaming disorder: An individual participant meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jack Ratcliffe","Nick Ballou","Laurissa Tokarchuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639008e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008e3,"objectID":"4e3f3b3b32a44060271ac7ea984e2634","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions/","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern immersive virtual reality (IVR) often uses embodied con- trollers for interacting with virtual objects.

This study attempts to understand whether sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can cognitively be considered as actions or gestures. It does this by comparing verb-learning outcomes between two conditions: (1) where participants move the controllers without touching virtual objects (gesture condition); and (2) where partici- pants move the controllers and manipulate virtual objects (action condition).

A Content Analysis of Transparency and Openness Guidelines in HCI Journals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" As most of my PhD cohort can tell you, I think a lot about the impact of my research. It’s kind of crippling, actually. I get paid a pretty paltry sum (although I’m lucky enough to be better off than many other PhD students), and even though I’m fully aware that governments spend vastly larger sums of money on vastly dumber things than my research, I still can’t shake the feeling that taxpayers are keeping me afloat right now, and they deserve something tangible in return. This has become even more glaring when you think about the impact that the PhD students working on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine had. The social sciences just can’t compete with that.\nPart of this anxiety about impact is a reflection of how I arrived in the field of games psychology. My undergraduate and master were in linguistics, and while I adored the content of what I was learning, I slowly began to feel that it was all rather useless. The “pure” linguists looked down at the computational linguists for not actually understanding the structure of language and instead reducing it down to probabilities (queue discussion about the sentence colorless green dreams sleep furiously)—while the buried elitist in me still believes that to a certain extent, the other side of the story is that computational linguistics were getting things done. It was easy to see the impact of their research on the world; we interacted with it every time we used Siri, or Google Translate, or any one of a million other things. (As an aside, I’m thrilled to be able to use automated translation for an upcoming interview study I’m doing. Thanks, computational linguists.)\nBut the feeling that my particular branch of linguistics—the phonetics of second language acquisition—had no real path to impacting everyday people was precisely what led me, with some meandering, to my current work. I found myself reading through some of the most prominent games-related research, much of which to this day is about violent games and aggression, and I thought to myself “these people don’t really seem to understand how games work, but their research is shaping public opinion all over the world. Maybe I can help make this a little better.”\nThis is where I hit my first challenge. I’m of the opinion that games can be—and most of the time, are—a powerful force for good. I think that play is a fundamental part of what it means to be human, I think games can be as expressive and artistic as any other medium you hold them up against, and I think the communities that form around gaming, at their best, add a tremendous amount of richness and connection to people’s lives. But to really build that argument, it felt like I needed first to disprove or qualify the reverse; I needed to address the often persuasive rhetoric that games are inherently harmful.\nAt my first Christmas at home after beginning my PhD, my sister-in-law asked me “so, have you found any evidence?” “Evidence for what?” I asked, confused. “That violent games lead to anti-social behavior.” She was concerned—and completely understandably so—that because all her sons’ friends were playing Fortnite, she had to either choose between depriving them of interaction with their friend group or exposing them to something that might negatively affect their development.\nI managed to avoid conducting research on violent video games, largely because—although I still regularly get notifications about new publications on that topic—I’m of the opinion that the evidence is clear: the effects are unreliable, the experiments that generated them do not generalize, and even when effects may exist, they’re not large enough to be societally meaningful.\nHowever, I did not manage to avoid the great game debate number two: (internet) gaming disorder. This is a topic that has been exploding in recent years, with no sign of slowing. And again, I think it is a topic that a lot of researchers misunderstand. I’m interested in motivation, but as soon as I ventured into that literature about why people play, you inevitably run up against the people asking why people play so much that it results in negative consequences to their life. I felt gaming disorder pulling at me like quicksand. When people asked me what I do, often their first questions were about gaming “addiction”, and I felt obligated to answer them. I found it easier to justify the impact of my work when it was related to specific people with a specific set of problems than when it was about something less concrete like “helping parents and players to manage their game use in a healthy way” or “informing designers about the potential motivational impacts of their design decisions”. These latter points sound good, and I do still believe that they are true and valuable, but the material steps I need to take to realize them are less obvious to me.\n","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"cc0a7d69d3ae4f13afdfe7afddce4927","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/quicksand/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/quicksand/","section":"blog","summary":"Some thoughts about a tension I've noticed in finding my research direction.","tags":[],"title":"Research Impact, and the Quicksand of Gaming Disorder","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Nick Ballou","Charles Gbadamosi","David Zendle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605139200,"objectID":"d99849a357d3e56e11188c4a188332aa","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2020-ballou-et-al-hidden/","publishdate":"2020-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ballou-et-al-hidden/","section":"publication","summary":"Loot boxes are the focus of growing research and regulatory attention. While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, and salience. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.","tags":null,"title":"The Hidden Intricacy of Loot Box Design: A Granular Description of Random Monetized Reward Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nick Ballou","Antonius J Van Rooij"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"fb2e69e82fa88fd4e1bd5dca12002a1b","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2020-ballou-van-rooij-relationship/","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ballou-van-rooij-relationship/","section":"publication","summary":"Gaming disorder (also known as dysregulated gaming) has received significant research and policy attention based on concerns that certain patterns of play are associated with decreased mental well-being and/or functional impairment. In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming: A specification curve analysis of five gaming disorder scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","Nick Ballou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"c7bc00662756e0b08f7a1d56a18e4a62","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.322112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face/","section":"publication","summary":"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee. These purchases may be purely aesthetic (cosmetic microtransactions); confer in-game advantages (pay to win microtransactions), or contain randomised contents of uncertain value (loot boxes).The growth of microtransactions has attracted substantial interest from both gamers, academics, and policymakers. However, it is not clear either how prevalent these features are in desktop games, or when any growth in prevalence occurred.In order to address this, we analysed the play history of the 463 most-played Steam desktop games from 2010 to 2019. Results of exploratory joinpoint analyses suggested that cosmetic microtransactions and loot boxes experienced rapid growth during 2012-2014, leading to high levels of prevalence by April 2019: 71.28% of the sample played games with loot boxes at this point, and 85.89% played games with cosmetic microtransactions. By contrast, pay to win microtransactions did not appear to experience similar growth in desktop games during the period, rising gradually to a prevalence of 17.38% by November 2015, at which point growth decelerated significantly (p\u003c0.001) to the point where it was not significantly different from zero (p=0.32).","tags":null,"title":"The Changing Face of Desktop Video Game Monetisation: An Exploration of Trends in Loot Boxes, Pay to Win, and Cosmetic Microtransactions in the Most-Played Steam Games of 2010-2019","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Many researchers and games industry professionals may be familiar with the “Player Experience of Need Satisfaction” (PENS)1 model as a way of understanding why video games are so incredibly motivating. If you aren’t, I hope this will be a decent primer. Those of you who are familiar with it, however, should especially stick around, because there’s a chance that some of what you’ve learned is incomplete or possibly outright incorrect.\nPENS is a theory of motivation in video games based on a big overarching theory of human motivation in general called self-determination theory (SDT)2. SDT is fundamentally concerned with well-being, defined here in eudaimonic (as opposed to hedonistic) terms; rather than maximizing pleasure or happiness, well-being in this sense is defined as thriving and flourishing, or being able to access the full range of human functioning. SDT states that intrinsically motivated activities—that is, activities that one undertakes purely for the joy and pleasure of doing them—are most supportive of well-being. Extrinsically motivated activities on the other hand (which can be broken down into four categories), will have less beneficial or downright negative effects on well-being. As we know, video games are really good at fostering intrinsic motivation; most (but not all) of the time, people play video games simply for the enjoyable experience of doing it. When discussing in these terms, intrinsic motivation is actually a formalized description of fun or enjoyment, which is precisely the experience that many (but again, not all) game developers strive to create for their players.\nFirst of all, let me come out and say it: I like SDT. Or, to maintain the illusion of being objective—even though there’s not a researcher, or human, on the planet fully capable of this—the evidence supporting SDT is pretty strong, and stronger than competing theories in my opinion. It is falsifiable, has improved since its conception in order to better account for forthcoming evidence, and has withstood a large number of severe tests3.\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s perfect or true, and it especially doesn’t mean that it’s always used appropriately. The 186 word description I just gave you represents as much depth, and in some cases more depth, than what I see in a large portion of games research based on PENS and SDT. Core aspects of SDT are often poorly measured or ignored, and simply used as vague sources of hypotheses or post hoc explanations. For reference, the flagship SDT textbook released in 2017 is 756 pages long. A lot of work has been done using this theory, and if we dig a little further than the surface-level descriptions found in a lot of papers on video games and motivation, we can learn a lot.\n","date":1582848e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"26af2aafc16e62c6a5a5beb8e32f9806","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/sdt-in-video-games-basic-needs-misunderstandings/","publishdate":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/sdt-in-video-games-basic-needs-misunderstandings/","section":"blog","summary":"Myths and misconceptions about what the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are, and why they matter in games.","tags":[],"title":"Self-determination theory in Video Games: Misconceptions about Basic Psychological Needs","type":"blog"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","Paul Cairns","Stuart Waters","Nick Ballou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"5dd0765d334975890f4e78019825927d","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/publication/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.320856Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background and Aims** Loot boxes are items in video games that may be bought for real-world money but provide ran- domized rewards. Formal similarities between loot boxes and gambling have led to concerns that they may provide a ‘gateway’ to gambling amongst children. However, the availability of loot boxes is unclear. This study aimed to determine what proportion of top-grossing video games contained loot boxes, and how many of those games were available to children. **Design, setting and cases** Survey of the 100 top-grossing games on both the Google Play store and the Apple App store, and the top 50 most-played games on Steam according to the data aggregator SteamSpy. Measurements The prevalence of loot boxes was measured for each platform outlined above, split by age rating. **Findings** A total of 58.0% of the top games on the Google Play store contained loot boxes, 59.0% of the top iPhone games contained loot boxes and 36.0% of the top games on the Steam store contained loot boxes; 93.1% of the Android games that featured loot boxes and 94.9% of the iPhone games that featured loot boxes were deemed suitable for children aged 12+.

I grew up in Hanover, NH, USA as an only child alongside our Jack Russell terrier, Thomas. Gaming was always a big part of my life, from Harry Potter Quidditch World Cup to Call of Duty to Super Smash Bros and more. During my childhood and early adolescence, I experienced times in which video games were a crucial, healthy outlet for me to develop my social skills and experience a sense of mastery and autonomy. At other times, however, I definitely exhibited signs of dysregulation.\nIt did not occur to me at this point, however, that this would be worth studying. For financial and misguided romantic reasons, I ended up at Tulane University in New Orleans for my bachelor. My original plan at Tulane was to design my own major in enigmatology, the study of puzzles, as my dream was to succeed Will Shortz as the New York Times crossword puzzle editor. This plan died a natural death in my sophomore year, at which point I took my fascination of puzzles and applied it to the enigma of language, graduating with a BS in linguistics and environmental studies in 2016.\nThis, unsurprisingly, did not lead to recruiters banging down my door upon graduation, so I chose to take something of a gap year and move to Vienna, where I put my German to use and worked as an au pair for a wonderful family. I took this time to develop my academic interests and put together my applications, eventually accepting an offer at the University of Cambridge. In 2018, I completed an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, where my research involved phonetics, automated learner assessment, and computer-assisted language learning (CALL).\nAt this point, I had begun to really like the research process–and believed that I could be good at it–but wasn’t seeing the meaningful connection between my work and the real world. A lot of linguistics seemed too much like an intellectual exercise for those capable of doing it. I began exploring research in other areas, and found myself delving into some of the seminal game psychology papers. To my surprise, I saw a disproportionate amount of research focused on elements of the games themselves, and not nearly enough on the relationship between players and their gaming. I had seen firsthand the range of impact games can have, but when I looked at the literature, I saw a lack of nuance occasionally slipping into outright demonization.\nWith some encouragement, I started to believe that I really could pursue research in these areas, and make up with diligent study what I lacked in psychology background. I knew I needed more time to settle on my precise research interests, however, so my partner and I moved to Hong Kong, where I worked as an English teacher at a public primary school. In addition to the obvious incredible travel opportunities, the job presented me with sufficient free time to continue reading up on video game psychology, developing my statistical methods, and also discover my interest in meta-science and reproducibility. In between lessons, I polished up my PhD applications and sent them off in early 2019.\nWhich brings us to today. I was offered a place at Queen Mary University of London with the Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI), a program with more than 60 PhD students researching every imaginable aspect of games (AI in games, music, narrative design, psychology, health, and much more). It’s been a great fit, and a program I can highly recommend to others: I’ve had excellent support from colleagues, supervisors, and administration.\nIn my free time, you can find me watching football (Arsenal), American football (Patriots), baseball (Red Sox), hockey (Bruins), or really whatever sport is on at that time of year. I also play tennis. My favorite games of all time include The Last of Us, Stardew Valley, and Hearthstone.\n","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"6f9d7d3b3ac3ddcf17c001472f33c103","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/about-me/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me/","section":"blog","summary":"A little more detail about who I am and why I study what I study.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Last year, I was interviewed by a friend of mine for his sociology master’s thesis on the topic of selfies. I was asked to prepare three selfies that I’d taken, and we talked for an hour or so about why I take selfies/photos more generally, and why I sometimes choose to post those photos online. My response, which paralleled those of some other participants, largely revolved around having a distilled ‘highlight reel’ of the things I’ve done in one central place that other people could contribute to by tagging me in photos of their own. To the extent that I can accurately identify my own motivations, the element of sharing those photos is secondary to my desire to organize my experiences into more coherent narratives than those found in the chaos of my iCloud photo library.\nI find this to be a useful way of thinking about the value of writing online as well. This is not the first time I’ve contemplated starting a blog of some kind, but I’ve always talked myself out of it using the argument that I’d be shouting into the technological void. There are simply too many blogs of which too few are interesting, and even fewer topics about which I feel qualified to speak. Of the ~4,000,000,000 people on the internet, what could I write that hasn’t already been written more cogently by someone with far more knowledge than myself?\nAlmost nothing, is the short answer. But maybe that’s okay, because using writing as a way to organize my own thoughts and feelings can be valuable even if I’m the only person that ever reads the words. That’s what I’m going to try today.\nAnd so, given that I’ve been writing about writing, I thought that a logical topic for this post might be my writing process. Although judging the objective quality of my own writing is difficult (especially in university, where the quality of the writing is often difficult to separate from the quality of the ideas), I am confident that I am a drastically better writer now than I was during my bachelor, or even the beginning of my master a year and a half ago. I’d like to spend a moment thinking about how that happened and what I can learn from it.\nIn what I believe to be both cause and effect, as my writing improved, my writing process was changing as well. When I began as a writer—which I consider to have been in high school, the first time one was asked to really edit a piece of work before submitting it—I was a typical edit-as-you-go writer. I’d write a sentence, delete it, write it again, write a paragraph, delete the first sentence again, replace it, and so on. If I got stuck on a word, I’d go on an extensive internet search to find it or a worthy synonym. When I finished, I’d give it a quick proofread and call it a day.\nLater, as I progressed through my undergrad, I was producing longer pieces of writing, and this ‘start from the beginning and move linearly to the end’ strategy no longer worked so well. My approach unconsciously shifted, and I found myself breaking my work into progressively smaller chunks. At one point, I worked on major sections (i.e., introduction, methods) one piece at a time until they were finished; later, it was individual paragraphs. Continuing down that path, the strategy I currently employ tackles even smaller pieces. When I write these days, I put the ideas together like I’m putting together puzzle pieces without having the box to look at. Below are the general steps I take when producing a written work.\nFor academic writing: I first make an outline. What is my research question and what are my hypotheses? I often see these two things collapsed into one, but the difference between them is crucial and describing that has helped organize my writing. Read, read, read, using Zotero to keep track of all the articles I’ve read with notes, annotated PDFs, tags, and citation information. For all writing: I write down any and all thoughts (i.e. puzzle pieces) that come into my head. * If this is an academic piece, I do this while I do my literature review, making 50-100 word summaries of each article that I read alongside a few of my own thoughts and/or an especially interesting quote. When the combined length of my puzzle pieces is approximately the length of the piece I’m writing, I begin to reorganize these disparate thoughts, placing ones with similar themes in proximity to each other, but without yet merging them. This is the point at which I often create my section headings and titles. I then begin to combine puzzle pieces into components of the same larger topic, trying where possible to follow the structure of my outline (but also recognizing that outlines will never exactly match the output). For example, one study on the perception of vowels and another on the perception of consonants could be merged into a single section on perception of phonemes. As the puzzle pieces begin to fit together into larger, more lucid chunks, I begin to smooth out the edges, adding transition sentences between ideas and paragraphs, adding …","date":1553472e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553472e3,"objectID":"df93ea7ccfef2c422c63c0906c887743","permalink":"https://Prathikvijaykumar.github.io/blog/welcome-and-writing-process/","publishdate":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/welcome-and-writing-process/","section":"blog","summary":"A somewhat long-winded summary of my personal writing process, and the struggle to write at all.","tags":[],"title":"Welcome, and Some Thoughts About Writing","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
